# 42Halloween_WOB_FUN

A Fun experiment with the nms tool created by @bartobri. For description it is a command line tool that recreats the hacking effects in movie scene.

1. Do a Git Clone 
2.  ```cd```  to the folder
3. Run:    ``` ./terminal_.fun.sh ```

-->>  To have the same prank on somebody else's computer put them in to shell source file(if you know what I mean,if not send me a msg in discord) :P 

Prequisite: Remember to install the ncurses library from [Here(ncurses support)](https://github.com/bartobri/no-more-secrets/blob/master/NCURSES.md)

OUTPUT: -->> Just run it to see it :xD (



Learning outcome:

1. Usage of the Pipe (|) in Bash in Terminal.
2. Bypassing access without admin rights and run files/scripts at startup of Terminal
3. Manipulation of bash/zsh shell source file.

Further Modifications:

I would like some input from everyone. We can build something more fun out of this :D
