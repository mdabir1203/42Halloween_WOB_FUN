# NMS_MOD_42Halloween

A Fun experiment with the nms tool created by @bartobri. For description it is a command line tool that recreats the hacking effects in movie scene.

1. Do a Git Clone 
2.  ```cd```  to the folder
3. Run:    ``` ./terminal_.fun.sh ```

-->>  To have the same prank on somebody else's computer put them in to shell source file(if you know what I mean,if not send me a msg in discord) :P 

Prequisite: Remember to install the ncurses library from [Here(ncurses support)](https://github.com/bartobri/no-more-secrets/blob/master/NCURSES.md)

OUTPUT: -->> Just run it to see it :xD (



Learning outcome:
I got to know how the pipe output works and how to use a library even if you don't have the admin access to a computer. How to manually direct the file 
to run from Terminal. Overall it was some small creative idea to implement.

Further Modifications:

I would like some input from everyone. We can build something more fun out of this :D
